    "### Introduction to the SIR Model and Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "The SIR model is built based on the first-order derivative to model the spread of infectious disease, where the time dependent variables $S$, $I$, $R$ each represent the following populations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S$(susceptible): number of individuals who are not infected but could become infected\n",
    "\n",
    "$I$(infected): number of individuals who are already infected and can spread disease\n",
    "\n",
    "$R$(removed): number of individuals who are either recovered and immune or have died\n",
    "    \n",
    "And $s$, $i$, $r$ are used to represent the proportion of susceptible, infected and removed individuals among the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parameters $b$ and $k$ in the model, where $b$ indicates the number of interactions each day that could spread the disease (per individual) and $k$ indicates the fraction of the infectious population which recovers each day. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the ODE-based model, we can get the following system of differential equations, where $t$ is time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{ds}{dt} = -b * s(t) * i(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{dr}{dt} = k * i(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{di}{dt} = b * s(t) * i(t) - k * i(t)$\n",
