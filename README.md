project-group-2 created by GitHub Classroom

For this project, we created a directory docs which includes a python package sir, a script.py for both agent based and ODE simulation, and a test.py for sir package.
For the midterm checkpoint, we have midtermreport.pdf as well its latex version included in the doc directory.

To run the code, using the command "python script.py" for the script.py and all the graphs will be generated.
Use the command "pytest test.py" for the test file.
